apparently, the folders and files that belong to the nodemodules could not be uploaded here due to quantity and size. However, you can just create them directly by installing json-server
on your machine at the master branch. ie after installing json-server on your machine, all you need is to copy the folder 'public'  to the root directory.
Then you'll need to run the command json-server --watch db.json on your root directory using the command prompt.
